The Fluffy Bunny and the Squeaky Gate

Once upon a time thar was a fluffy little bunny named Carl.  Carl was an adventurous bunny, and liked to wander far from home.
  
One day he saw some delicious carrots growing in a stranger's yard.  "I'm gonna go eat those carrots!", Carl said to himself.

So Carl snuck up the path, slowly opened the gate, and then rushed to the carrots as fast as he could.  He wasn't half-way to the carrots when he heard a sound unlike anything he'd ever heard before.  **"SQUEEK!"** went the sound.  Carl froze, fearing a bird overhead.  **"SQUEEK!"** it went again.  he ran to the nearest bush and hid.

The carrots were close, but there was no overhead protection.  He wanted those carrots, but he was afraid.  He hid under the bush for an hour, and was beginning to think the coast was clear.

**SQUEEK!** went the sound again.  **SQUEEK!  BANG!**

Just then, a human came walking up the path.  He didn't know what to do!  He couldn't get the carrots, and he couldn't run home!

Carl was scared.  He did that old bunny trick of standing perfectly still so that the human didn't see him.  "OH NO!" Carl almost screamed as he saw the human picking the carrots out of the ground.  "She's taking my carrots!"

Carl sat there, a little afraid, and really disappointed.  "There's a bird trying to get me, a human trying to eat me, and I'm not even gonna get any carrots.  I want my mommy!"

The human walked by him three more times picking beans, pulling beats out of the ground, and even got some strange miniature-tree looking stuff off of a stalky plant.  Once she looked right at him!  But his bunny powers were so strong he held perfectly still... she just smiled and went on her way.

Carl watched her leave.  As she approached the gate, he thought, "Now I just need to figure out how to avoid the bird."

But as she left, she opened the gate.  **SQUEAK!  BANG!** went the gate as it closed behind her.

Carl was so relieved!  There wasn't a bird at all!  For some reason, the gate was making that noise.  He went home, sad he didn't get his carrots, but having learned something important - next time he's gonna get those carrots!
